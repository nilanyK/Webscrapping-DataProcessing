# Sustainable Nike Sneaker Marketplace ðŸ‘Ÿ

## Overview

E-commerce project focusing on second-hand Nike sneakers. Our mission is to empower users to make environmentally conscious and economically informed choices when purchasing second-hand footwear.

## Project Highlights

- **Customized Search on Vinted and Vestiaire Collective**: Enhanced both data scraping to support gender-specific searches with parameters such as gender, color, and size.

- **Carbon Footprint Estimation**: Calculated an approximate carbon footprint for each second-hand item using geopy and predefined emission rates.

- **Profit Calculation**: Provided users with profit calculation for each item by comparing the second-hand price with the average Nike price.

- **Streamlit App (Coming Soon)**: The next step is to develop a Streamlit app to offer users a user-friendly interface for exploring and purchasing second-hand Nike sneakers.
